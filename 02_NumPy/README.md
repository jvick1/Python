# Intro to NumPy

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library in Python used for scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is fundamental for data analysis and is widely used in fields such as data science, machine learning, and scientific research.

## Getting Started

Navigate to your folder, enter our datascience env (we made this in the initial `README.md` file), and we should already have numpy installed. If not try `conda install numpy`.

## Key Features of NumPy

- **N-dimensional Array Object (ndarray):** NumPy introduces the ndarray object, a powerful array type that allows for fast and efficient manipulation of large datasets.

- **Mathematical Functions:** NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions, including those for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, and random number generation.

- **Broadcasting:** This feature allows you to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes and sizes without the need for explicit looping.

- **Integration with C/C++ and Fortran Code:** NumPy can be used to interface with code written in C, C++, or Fortran, making it a versatile tool for performance-critical applications.

- **Data Handling and Storage:** NumPy can be used for efficient data handling, manipulation, and storage. It supports operations like reshaping, slicing, and indexing.

## What You'll learn in `01_NumPy_Arrays.ipynb`

In this section of the "Introduction to Python" repository, we explore the basics of NumPy, specifically focusing on arrays. We will cover creating and manipulating arrays, as well as some essential operations and functions.

Learn how to create simple **1- & 2-dimensional arrays**, the building blocks of more complex data structures. Utilize NumPyâ€™s **built-in mathematical functions** to perform calculations such as mean, standard deviation, and more. Learn about **broadcasting**, a powerful feature that allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. Generate random integers within a specified range using the `randint` function, useful for creating random test data. Explore other essential array operations such as reshaping, slicing, and indexing, which are vital for data manipulation.
