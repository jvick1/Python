In this repository, I will show you how to open your Anaconda terminal, navigate to your directory, launch Jupyter Notebooks from the command line, and demonstrate some of the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks.

# Anaconda Command Prompt

Launch your Anaconda Command Prompt. 

If you don't have Anaconda installed please finish the `README.md` file in the root folder before starting this repo.

Key commands include:
- `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (macOS/Linux): Show the contents of the current directory.
- `cd [directory]`: Change the current directory to the specified directory.
- `cd ..`: Move up one directory level.
- `mkdir [directory]`: Create a new directory.
- `conda list`: List all installed packages in the current environment.
- `conda env list`: List all available Conda environments.
- `conda activate [environment]`: Activate the specified Conda environment.
- `conda deactivate`: Deactivate the current Conda environment.
- `jupyter notebook`: Launch Jupyter Notebooks from the command line.

In the example below I change my drive, cd into `E:\Code`, print the directory, cd into `Python`, create a new folder, cd into that, and launch my Jupyter Notebook from there.
