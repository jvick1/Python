## What You'll learn in `01_Intro_to_Python.ipynb`

This is the first section of the "Introduction to Python" repository. In this repo, we cover fundamental topics such as mathematical, string, and list operations. 

Understanding these basic operations is crucial for any programming task in Python. **Mathematical operations** allow you to perform calculations, manipulate data, and solve problems efficiently. **String operations** enable you to handle and manipulate text, which is essential for tasks such as data processing and user input. **List operations** are foundational for managing collections of data, enabling you to store, access, and manipulate groups of items effectively.

Each chapter is organized with numbered sections, and within each section, you'll find detailed explanations and examples of various operations.
